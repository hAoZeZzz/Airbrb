1.We have added contrast to all buttons and text to make our website more accessible to people with disabilities.
2.We use a mobile design that makes it easier for people with disabilities to use our website on devices with different resolutions.
3.It is possible to use tab to freely interact with elements on our website, and we highlight selected elements while keeping the page tidy.
4.We added alt to all the images on the page so that we could add alternative textual information for users with poor web experience, or visually impaired users.
5.We added placeholders to all forms to make it easier for users to understand what to enter.
6.We have error trapping for all Promises, so that if a function returns an error, it tells the user in the form of an alert.
